# Bible Reading Challenge

An application for coordinated reading schedules to read through the Bible together with customizable personal and group schedules, push notifications, emails, and lots of statistics.

Supports multiple deployments of the application running from the same source code and database, each customizable to match branding.

# Dependencies

## Language

Written with php `8.2.20` and apache `2.4.61`

- REQUIRES php `8.2` because of [this bug](https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/8292) and Mailgun's API for bulk sending

## Configuration

Set the system time zone and php time zone (`date.timezone` in `php.ini`) to the same thing.

In `php.ini`, set the following:

```
max_input_vars = 3000;
upload_max_filesize = 10M;
```

This is sufficient for editing a schedule that is up to 4 years long and typical picture uploads.

Install [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) dependencies in root of project with `composer install`

In apache and nginx configuration, be sure file uploads are also set to be at least 10MB.

## Database

#### SQLite

Requires MINIMUM version 3.46 (support for `GROUP_CONCAT(..ORDER BY..)`, `->>` syntax, and `strftime('%U')` modifier)

Create an SQLite database file named "brc.db" in root of project from schema.sql

Initialize it with the data from `migrations/bible-import.sql`

Enable WAL mode: `sqlite3 brc.db "PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL;"`

An example backup script example can be found in `extras/db-backup.sh`

#### Redis

Redis is used for session management.

Run a Redis (or compatible) server, default ports.

```sh
# Server
docker run -v /home/bible-reading-challenge/:/data --restart unless-stopped -d -it -p 6379:6379 redis:7-alpine
# locally
docker run -it --rm -v ./:/data -p 6379:6379 redis:7-alpine
```

##### Stats

to refresh stats use `redis-cli --scan --pattern "bible-reading-challenge:user-stats/*" | xargs -L 1 redis-cli del`

### Schema

to export the schema after an update, run `sqlite3 brc.db ".schema --indent" > migrations/schema.sql`

## Realtime updates

This website supports readers' seeing each other on the page reading together

### Setup

From the `socket` directory, run `npm i` and then keep it alive with `forever start server.js`

It defaults to port `8085`, customizable with the environment variable `SOCKET_PORT`

## API Keys

Each site created in the database requires the following values in the 'env' column

### Emails

For deployment-wide administration emails (not site-specific emails), configure postfix or whatever [PhpMailer's sendmail](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/blob/v6.9.3/examples/sendmail.phps) is going to interface with. Requires `.env` variables:

- DEPLOYMENT_EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS
- DEPLOYMENT_EMAIL_TO_ADDRESS

I set up mine with OCI Email Delivery following [this guide](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Email/Reference/postfix.htm)

### Google Sign-in button

also requires configuring OAuth consent screen in Google Cloud Console. Save this in an `.env` file at the project root

- GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
- GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET (currently unused)

## Crons

files in the `cron` directory should be installed according to the comments at the top of each file

## Migrations

Any scripts in the `migration` directory are meant to be run-once for a particular purpose (e.g., initiating streaks mid-challenge). See comments in each file.

Numbers indicate the order in which scripts were created and the date changed.

From the root of the project, run `extras/dump-schema.sh` to save the current database schema to `migrations/schema.sql`

## Logo Generation

For different logo sizes to be generated for PWA installation, the `magick` command must be avilable somewhere in the `PATH` environment. See `logo_pngs()` in `Site.php` where `set_include_path()` is called
